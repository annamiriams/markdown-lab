Below are just a few useful CLI commands that I learned from peers and that, to my recollection, were not included in the Canvas CLI lessons.

## Creating a new directory

Initially, we learned how to create a directory and enter it with the following steps:

```
mkdir example-directory
cd example-directory
```

I find it far more efficient to use the following _single_ step instead:

```
mkcd example-directory
```

You can see from the `mkcd` command that it's a combination of `mkdir` and `cd` and gets the job done a little faster.

> Tip: There are times when you don't want to use `mkcd`, so be mindful of when you choose to use it!

## Terminal tabs

Ever need multiple terminal tabs open? It's as simple as **ctrl+shift+t**.

> Tip: This works on my PC, though a quick google search shows me you'd use **command+t** on a mac.

## Clearing your terminal

Once you're all done practicing the steps above, you may want to clear your terminal to start fresh. All you need to do is type the command `clear` and then hit **enter**.
